# wp-bulk-create-pages
Wordpress Plugin: Upload a CSV of external website URI's and convert to wordpress pages/posts by specifying content selectors.

Have you ever had to copy a website's pages over to wordpress into a new design but you didn't have the hosting or Wordpress login? Or maybe it's not in Wordpress at all! Well this plugin has you covered.

Upload a CSV of URI's from the live site along with any redirects you will be adding. 
Select whether to import Pages, Posts, or have the plugin autodetect searching the body tag for "single-post".
Input the selector for the content you're importing. Usually sites have the same class arround the main content like ".entry-content".
Click import and be patient as the plugin created pages for you.
